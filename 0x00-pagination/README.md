# 0x00. Pagination
Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination.
Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.
Paging requires an implied ordering. By default this may be the itemâ€™s unique identifier, but can be other ordered fields such as a created date.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Pagination types
1. Offset pagination
2. Keyset pagination
3. Seek pagination
